# DESCRIPTION

**m** is a really simple wrapper for mpc. **m** is for music, minimalism.


# RATIONALE

I like mpc but I don't use all its commands and I find them constraining to type. 
The idea was to have a simple music player with just the bare minimum. 
Think of a player that doesn't gets in your way, it just plays music or doesn't. 
You don't have to think about it and can do anything else. Should you want to
modify what it is doing, you can do it with:

* a button to play/pause

    	m

* `m n`: to play the next song

* `m p`: to play the previous song

* `m -`: to decrease the volume

* `m +`: to increase the volume

* `m s`: to display the current status

* `m <n>`: to jump to the nth track 

* `m l`: to list the tracks in the current playlist

* `m u`: to empty the current playlist and update the database

* `m h`: to display a help message

That's all. 

If you want to use more commands of mpc, just type **m** followed by
this command. **m** is just my version of a simple music player I use when I just
want to listen to music and don't want to care about complex configurations or
fancy stuffs. 


# TODO

* Add mpc completions

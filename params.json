Should you want to\r\nmodify what it is doing, you can do it with:\r\n\r\n* a button to play/pause\r\n\r\n    \tm\r\n\r\n* a command to play the next song\r\n\r\n    \tm n\r\n\r\n* a command to play the previous song\r\n\r\n    \tm p\r\n\r\n* a command to decrease the volume\r\n\r\n   \t\tm -\r\n\r\n* a command to increase the volume\r\n\r\n    \tm +\r\n\r\n* a command to display the current status\r\n\r\n    \tm s\r\n\r\n* a command to jump to the nth track \r\n\r\n    \tm <n>\r\n\r\n* a command to list the tracks in the current playlist\r\n\r\n    \tm l\r\n\r\n* a command to empty the current playlist and update the database\r\n\r\n    \tm u\r\n\r\n* a command to display a help message\r\n\r\n    \tm h\r\n\r\nThat's all. \r\n\r\nIf you want to use more commands of mpc, just type **m** followed by\r\nthis command. **m** is just my version of a simple music player I use when I just\r\nwant to listen to music and don't want to care about complex configurations or\r\nfancy stuffs. \r\n\r\n\r\n# TODO\r\n\r\n* Add mpc completions\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
